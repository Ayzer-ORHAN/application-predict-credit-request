# Application Predict Credit Request

This Flask application enables credit applicants to determine whether their credit request will be accepted or not.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to utilize machine learning algorithms to assess credit loan applications and make predictions about the likelihood of approval based on historical loan data and other pertinent factors.

## How it Works

The application is built upon a dataset [Loan Prediction Problem Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset) obtained from Kaggle, which includes a comprehensive collection of loans requests.


## Installation

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the Flask application:

        python3 main.py

## Usage

Enter the application, fill in the selection criteria, and press 'Predict' to see if the credit application is accepted or rejected.
